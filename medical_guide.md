# Medical guide for international students


Before signing up for public healthcare there are previous steps to make. Here we will guide you on each one.

# Step 1: Registration with the municipal residents' register (*Empadronamiento o padrón municipal*)

Registering in the municipal register of residents is compulsory for everyone living in Barcelona. When it is done, the document attesting to an individual's current registration in the municipal register, certifying the registration, is received. It is an essential formality that gives access to certain rights, such as public healthcare and basic schooling for children. It is also necessary to apply for the certificate of registration as an EU national, for people with European citizenship, or the identity card for foreign nationals (TIE), for people with non-EU citizenship.

In addition, registration is also one of the indispensable requirements to be complied with by people from the European Union, or from countries with which Spain has signed a reciprocity agreement, in order to have the right to vote in local elections.

# Step 2: Apply for a healthcard (*Tarjeta Sanitaria Individual*)
        
The individual health card (TSI) identifies and accredits citizens as users of the public health system of Catalonia. The first is free and facilitates access to the centers of the public health network. Also to present to pharmacies in order to obtain medicines financed by the Catalan Health Service.
        
The card is personal and non-transferable and each family member must have their TSI, regardless of their age. It contains the personal identification code (CIP).
        
You can request your card directly at your local CAP/Health Centre (*centre* d'atenció primària)

# Step 3: Register at your local CAP
        
The CAP (*centre* d'atenció primària) is the first level of health care services in Barcelona and its metropolitan area. These CAP’s are medical centres that offer general medical attention, prevention, health promotion and elderly health services. This is the **first entry point for the medical system**, and you must be registered officially in order to be able to get specialized services, like hospital or specialist visits or checks.
        
The medical system in Barcelona works according to your zone of residency. This means that you will be **appointed a CAP that is based on your living address**.
        
**In person:** The easiest way to register at your CAP/Health Centre is to go directly there and do it in person. You will receive the card at your home in 2 to 3 weeks.To check which CAP/Health Centre corresponds to your neighbourhood, go to [https://catsalut.gencat.cat/ca/centres-sanitaris/quin-cap-correspon-a-una-adreca/index.html#googtrans(ca|en)](https://catsalut.gencat.cat/ca/centres-sanitaris/quin-cap-correspon-a-una-adreca/index.html#googtrans(ca%7Cen))

# Health emergencies
        
Emergency medical assistance is provided in CAPs and hospitals. CAPs deal with most emergencies during normal working hours.
        
Outside of working hours, you can go to an emergency primary healthcare centre, which attends to people 24 hours a day throughout the year. These centres work in collaboration with emergency hospital services and **the Medical Emergencies System (SEM).**
        
You can also phone 061 (**CatSalut Respon**), a service that covers the entire Catalan region 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. We recommend you phone an emergencies centre before you visit it, to make sure there are not too many patients already there. There are some 200 doctors, nursers and specialists working for this helpline, with experience in providing assistance on the phone and in writing. In addition, it also has a translation and interpreting service.
        
# Hospitals
        
Barcelona has 58 hospitals (12 of which are public and 46 private). 
Of its private hospitals, 24 are part of the national healthcare system’s Public Use Hospitals Network (XHUP).
        
Barcelona’s main hospitals are: [Hospital Clínic](https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en), [Hospital del Mar](https://www.parcdesalutmar.cat/en/), [Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau](http://www.santpau.es/en/) and [Hospital Universitari de la Vall d’Hebron](https://www.vallhebron.com/en). Their websites are available in several languages.
        
These hospitals offer excellent emergency services and elective and non-elective medical treatment. They have some of the best medical professionals in the country as well as the latest in medical technology.
        
# Private medical insurance
        
Some people opt for private medical insurance. The advantages are immediate access to specialists, a wider range of professionals available and shorter waiting times for visits and treatments.
        
Mutual insurance companies (insurers) have their own network of hospitals, clinics and laboratories and offer some services that the public system does not cover.
        
Note that most companies only cover the care offered by the professionals who appear on the lists of their medical directories, although some refund a percentage of the fees charged by professionals who are not on these lists.
        
# Pharmacies
        
If you have a minor health problem, you can go to a pharmacy, where the pharmacists will advise you on the non-prescription medicines you can take.

Bear in mind that there are duty pharmacies that are open throughout the night, on weekends and during public holidays. Some even open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
