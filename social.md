# Social committee

Could you imagine a group of friends without linked members? Or a company whose workers were not able to talk among them? That’s what we’d like to avoid with this committee. Maybe sometimes we don’t have the space or the time to talk about different concerns we have in mind (either important or not-so-important ones). The aim of this committee will rely on organising different events with a distended vibe to know better your neighbouring colleges and build a healthy and active PhD community:

- Coffee sessions ☕️ (2nd Wednesday of each month)
- Happy hours 🍻
- MELIS PhD dinner 🍝
- Welcome Week 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️
- PhD retreat 🕺
