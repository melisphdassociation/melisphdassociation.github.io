# Welcome week committee

Everyone knows that doing a PhD can be daunting to say the least: a big project, new team, different methodologies and most often a whole new city! To help new PhDs navigate these turbolent new waters, the Welcome week commitee is here to hold you hand...figuratively of course.

The first couple of weeks we will be holding small "crash courses" of basic statistics, biology and informatics taught by more senior PhDs. If you have signed up for it, we will also introduce you to your "buddy", a 2nd to 4th year PhD student who will be your co-pilot the first few months! We will also organise a tour of the massive PRBB so you know what is what and, most importantly, where to get your coffee (it's not as straightforward as you'd think). Finally, as part of the MELIS welcome talk we will organise a small "get to know each other" beer session üç∫üçª.
