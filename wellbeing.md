# Researcher Mental Health Observatory

ReMO focuses on wellbeing and mental health within academia, a theme of strategic importance for the European Research Area. Previous research shows that low levels of wellbeing and mental health problems have a negative impact on individual, team and organizational performance, triggering significant costs. In addition, institutional context, organizational structure and culture, as well as managerial practices have significant impact on wellbeing and health of employees. Therefore, general insights on the causes of workplace wellbeing and mental health need to be refined with contextual specifics (i.e. in academia) in order to develop tailored, effective and efficient prevention and action programs.

Before signing up for public healthcare there are previous steps to make. Here we will guide you on each one.

# Step 1: Registration with the municipal residents' register (*Empadronamiento o padr√≥n municipal*)

Registering in the municipal register of residents is compulsory for everyone living in Barcelona. When it is done, the document attesting to an individual's current registration in the municipal register, certifying the registration, is received. It is an essential formality that gives access to certain rights, such as public healthcare and basic schooling for children. It is also necessary to apply for the certificate of registration as an EU national, for people with European citizenship, or the identity card for foreign nationals (TIE), for people with non-EU citizenship.

In addition, registration is also one of the indispensable requirements to be complied with by people from the European Union, or from countries with which Spain has signed a reciprocity agreement, in order to have the right to vote in local elections.

Requirements: You must be of legal age, reside in the city of Barcelona and not already appear in the city‚Äôs register of residents at the user: melisphdassociation
pass:  27112023dtime of registration.

Documents needed: 

### For those of legal age:

- **Spanish nationals**: DNI or passport.
- **European Union, Swiss, Norwegian, Icelandic or Liechtenstein nationals**: EU national certificate, passport or identity document from the country of origin. If the NIE (identity number for foreign nationals)
certificate is provided, it must always be accompanied by the passport
or identity document from the country of origin.
- **Nationals from all other countries**: identity card for foreign nationals (TIE) or passport.
- **Owned home**:
    - If you are listed as the owner on the property tax bill (IBI), you do not need to provide any supporting document as the authority
    automatically checks this internally.
    - If you are not listed as the owner on the property tax bill (IBI),
    proof of ownership must be provided with one of the following documents:
        - Deed of ownership of the property showing you as the owner. In the
        case of usufruct: express, signed authorisation by the right holder.
        Original and photocopy of your identity document.
        - Private contract of sale, not more than one year old, showing you to be the current owner.
        - In the case of inherited homes, deed of acceptance of the
        inheritance. The document must not be more than one year old, from the
        date of death of the person bequeathing the property.
        - Land register extract, valid for three months.
- **Rented home**:
    - Current tenancy agreement (not open-ended) with a minimum term
    of three months. If the term is less than three months, it must be an
    agreement extended beyond that time (the extension must be explicitly
    recorded).
    - Extended tenancy agreement, along with the current extension.
    - Expired tenancy agreement which is extended¬†(with no explicitly stated extension clause)
        - Last receipt for rent, paid within the last two months, which must show full details identifying the let.
        - Last bill or bank slip for utilities (bills for electricity, water
        and gas are accepted, while mobile phone and Internet connection bills
        are not), in the name of the tenant and within the last three months.
        The same coding as in the tenancy agreement must be shown.
        - Bank transfer, which must show the details needed to identify the rental.
    - Open-ended agreement, as long as four years or more have elapsed since the agreement came into force:
        - Last receipt for rent, paid within the last two months, which must show full details identifying the let.
        - Last bill or bank slip for utilities (electricity, water and gas),
        in the name of the tenant and within the last three months. The same
        coding as in the tenancy agreement must be shown. Mobile phone and
        Internet access contracts are not accepted.
        - Bank transfer, which must show the details needed to identify the rental.

    indefinite term, as long as four years or more have elapsed since the
    agreement came into force:
        - Last receipt for rent, paid within the last two months, which must show full details identifying the let.
        - Last bill or bank slip for utilities (electricity, water and gas),

        coding as in the tenancy agreement must be shown. Mobile phone and

        - Bank transfer, which must show the details needed to identify the rental.

        **Link to do online and in person**: **https://www.barcelona.cat/internationalwelcome/en/registration-municipal-register-residents-city-barcelona**
        
        # Step 2: Apply for a healthcard (*Tarjeta Sanitaria Individual*)
        
        The individual health card (TSI) identifies and accredits citizens as users of the public health system of Catalonia. The first is free and facilitates access to the centers of the public health network. Also to present to pharmacies in order to obtain medicines financed by the Catalan Health Service.
        
        The card is personal and non-transferable and each family member must have their TSI, regardless of their age. It contains the personal identification code (CIP).
        
        You can request your card directly at your local CAP/Health Centre (*centre* d'atenci√≥ prim√†ria)
        
        **Link to request card online:** https://web.gencat.cat/en/tramits/tramits-temes/8144_-_Targeta_sanitaria_individual_TSI
        
        # Step 3: Register at your local CAP
        
        The CAP (*centre* d'atenci√≥ prim√†ria) is the first level of health care services in Barcelona and its metropolitan area. These CAP‚Äôs are medical centres that offer general medical attention, prevention, health promotion and elderly health services. This is the **first entry point for the medical system**, and you must be registered officially in order to be able to get specialized services, like hospital or specialist visits or checks.
        
        The medical system in Barcelona works according to your zone of residency. This means that you will be **appointed a CAP that is based on your living address**.
        
        **In person:** The easiest way to register at your CAP/Health Centre is to go directly there and do it in person. You will receive the card at your home in 2 to 3 weeks.To check which CAP/Health Centre corresponds to your neighbourhood, go to [https://catsalut.gencat.cat/ca/centres-sanitaris/quin-cap-correspon-a-una-adreca/index.html#googtrans(ca|en)](https://catsalut.gencat.cat/ca/centres-sanitaris/quin-cap-correspon-a-una-adreca/index.html#googtrans(ca%7Cen))
        
        **Online:**
        
        [Click here](https://salut.gencat.cat/pls/rca/RCAPKTSI.SOLICITAR_TSI) and complete the form.
        
        Select the corresponding option with step 2 (Datos personales II and Tipo de Seguro). **Select *CatSalut* if you‚Äôre a foreigner**.
        
        Step 3 is filling in the information regarding your address and your contact details.
        
        Step 4 (Datos de la TSI): select the one that matches your situation.
        
        Step 5 (Confirmaci√≥n): attach a copy of your *empadronamiento* (if necessary) and then click on proceed to complete the registration process.
        
        # Step 4: Book an appointment
        
        Book an appointment with your GP through the CatSalut website.
        
        Link: https://catsalut.gencat.cat/ca/coneix-catsalut/acces-sistema-salut/com-accedeix/programacio-visites/
        
        # Health emergencies
        
        Emergency medical assistance is provided in CAPs and hospitals. CAPs deal with most emergencies during normal working hours.
        
        Outside of working hours, you can go to an emergency primary healthcare centre, which attends to people 24 hours a day throughout the year. These centres work in collaboration with emergency hospital services and **the Medical Emergencies System (SEM).**
        
        You can also phone 061 (**CatSalut Respon**), a service that covers the entire Catalan region 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. We recommend you phone an emergencies centre before you visit it, to make sure there are not too many patients already there. There are some 200 doctors, nursers and specialists working for this helpline, with experience in providing assistance on the phone and in writing. In addition, it also has a translation and interpreting service.
        
        # Hospitals
        
        Barcelona has 58 hospitals (12 of which are public and 46 private). 
        Of its private hospitals, 24 are part of the national healthcare 
        system‚Äôs Public Use Hospitals Network (XHUP).
        
        Barcelona‚Äôs main hospitals are: [Hospital Cl√≠nic](https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en), [Hospital del Mar](https://www.parcdesalutmar.cat/en/), [Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau](http://www.santpau.es/en/)¬†and [Hospital Universitari de la Vall d‚ÄôHebron](https://www.vallhebron.com/en). Their websites are available in several languages.
        
        These hospitals offer excellent emergency services and elective and 
        non-elective medical treatment. They have some of the best medical 
        professionals in the country as well as the latest in medical 
        technology.
        
        # Private medical insurance
        
        Some people opt for private medical insurance. The advantages are 
        immediate access to specialists, a wider range of professionals 
        available and shorter waiting times for visits and treatments.
        
        Mutual insurance companies (insurers) have their own network of 
        hospitals, clinics and laboratories and offer some services that the 
        public system does not cover.
        
        Note that most companies only cover the care offered by the 
        professionals who appear on the lists of their medical directories, 
        although some refund a percentage of the fees charged by professionals 
        who are not on these lists.
        
        # Pharmacies
        
        If you have a minor health problem, you can go to a pharmacy, where 
        the pharmacists will advise you on the non-prescription medicines you 
        can take.
        
        Bear in mind that there are duty pharmacies that are open throughout 
        the night, on weekends and during public holidays. Some even open 24 
        hours a day, seven days a week.
