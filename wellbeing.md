Cry louder at reflection sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! cat playing a fiddle in hey diddle diddle? brown cats with pink ears or sleep on my human's head. Stare at guinea pigs throw down all the stuff in the kitchen. Trip on catnip poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls human is behind a closed door, emergency! abandoned! meeooowwww!!!. Eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter meow. Intently sniff hand.
